import SwiftUI

/// Hosts live node views (WKWebView, MKMapView, AVPlayerView, etc.)
/// on top of the Canvas.
///
/// Placed in a ZStack above the Canvas so each overlay is a real SwiftUI
/// view rather than a Canvas symbol, letting native representables retain
/// their own rendering loop, scroll views, video decoders, and input
/// handling.
///
/// Re-evaluates the caller-supplied `nodeContent` closure for every node
/// inside the viewport with `flowNodeRenderPhase = .live` injected, so
/// any `LiveNode` declared inside that closure automatically switches
/// from its rasterize branch to its live branch. Nodes the overlay
/// considers inactive stay mounted at `opacity(0)` with hit testing
/// disabled — this preserves WKWebView / MKMapView identity (page load
/// state, scroll position, JS state, player state) across active↔inactive
/// toggles and eliminates the teardown/reload flicker that happens when
/// the subtree is conditionally removed.
///
/// ## Plain-node pass-through
///
/// Not every row the overlay hosts contains a `LiveNode` — callers mix
/// live nodes with plain content (e.g. `.resizable` nodes). Rows that do
/// contain a `LiveNode` publish their ID via ``LiveNodePresenceKey``;
/// rows absent from the aggregated set keep `opacity = 0` and hit testing
/// off even when "active," so Canvas-level drag / selection gestures
/// don't get swallowed by the invisible overlay layer.
///
/// ## Two-phase deactivation
///
/// Activation "rendered" state is owned by
/// ``LiveNodeActivationCoordinator``, not by the raw predicate result.
/// When the predicate flips `true → false` the coordinator awaits the
/// `LiveNode`-registered capture handler before lowering `renderedActive`
/// — so the rasterize path has a fresh snapshot the instant the overlay
/// fades. The overlay reads `coordinator.renderedActive` for opacity / hit
/// testing, and feeds each body evaluation back in with `update(...)` so
/// predicate edges trigger the coordinator's transitions.
///
/// Off-screen nodes are culled from the overlay so we don't pay for
/// WKWebView page loads, SwiftUI subtree work, or capture costs that
/// nobody can see. Nodes scrolled back into view remount fresh and
/// re-seed their snapshot via `LiveNode`'s mount-time capture.
///
/// The overlay layer itself does not paint any background, so empty space
/// between active nodes passes pointer events through to the Canvas
/// underneath.
